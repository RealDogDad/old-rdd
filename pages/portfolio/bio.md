Birthdate: {$page.dob_day$} / {$page.dob_month$}

Brandan Foster enlisted in the United Stated Marines at 18 years old. He spent the first 2 years of his Marine Corps career in Washington D.C. serving out of the historic Marine Barracks Washington 8th and I. Brandan was involved in countless ceremonies, parades and honors in the Nation's Capitol including participating in General James 'Jim' Mattis' retirement in 2013. In 2013, Brandan graduated Marine Security Guard school and was ordered to activate the Marine detachment at U.S. Embassy Podgorica, Montenegro. Brandan was then selected for a post at U.S. Consulate Chengdu, China. After serving as the Training and Operations NCO, Brandan wanted to go to Kyiv, Ukraine and submitted a request. Brandan served as the Training and Operations NCO at U.S. Embassy Kyiv, Ukraine. Brandan finally completed his obligated service to the USMC in December of 2016 and moved to Miami, Florida with his now wife Kayla. He got a dog name Luna from Broward humane society, began studying and figuring out his pathway. In 2017, Kayla, Brandan and Luna moved to Seattle, WA where Brandan began studying at North Seattle College. In 2019, Brandan was accepted to the Seattle College's Application Development program where he is currently studying Mobile, Web, Software and Cloud development and a little Data Science. He is set to graduate in June 2021. If he could choose his next job he would like to automate manufacturing processes or use Machine Learning and Data Science in J.I.T. and Lean logistics. Brandan spends his off time honing his in-game (& IRL) aim, planning his next PC build or prepping his Kona Process 153 for another dirt church sermon. He has two pitbull mixes that follow him on pretty much every adventure and likes to spend his time among the trees.
