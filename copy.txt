Blurb: Hey there, its Brandan. I'm a USMC Veteran who just graduated with a degree in Applications Development and am ready to learn from the industry's best Engineers, Designers, and Architects. I focused my time in school on cloud technologies but have successfully deployed a cross-platform mobile app. I am currently obssessed with IaC (Infrastructure as Code) through tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, and Google Cloud Deployment Manager. In my off-time, I mountain bike, build gaming PCs and am an active part of a MilSim Unit "1st Battalion 1st Marines" in OWI's Squad.

My perfect job would include automation, data analysis or delivery pipelines.
